    <p>
      This extension will allow you to save images from websites to a 
      Picasa / Google+ photo album with 1 click.  This is useful for quickly 
      creating your own "pin board," or if you're like me, for creating a 
      repository of reply gifs to use more quickly in Hangouts.
    </p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This only works for saving images, specifically images with the .bmp, 
        .gif, .jpeg, or .png file type.  This is a restriction of 
        Picasa / Google+, not mine.
      </li>
      <li>
        You cannot create a new album with this extension.  You must either 
        choose a pre-existing album in Picasa / Google+, or create one in 
        either service.
      </li>
      <li>
        To use, right click on an image and select "Save image to G+ Album." 
        The image will then be uploaded to the album chosen before opening a 
        new tab with the image in your album.
      </li>
    </ul>
